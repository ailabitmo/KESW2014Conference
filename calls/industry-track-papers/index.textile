title: Call for Industry Track
---

For the industry track we solicit papers that describe practical experience of using Semantic Web or KR-related technologies in practical projects. Descriptions of industrial deployments and production usage are especially invited but papers with preliminary experience are also welcome (as long as the authors are able to demonstrate, preferably with some quantitative data, practical utility of Semantic Web technologies in a particular domain).
Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

* Applications of Semantic Web technologies in various industrial domains.
* Applications of Semantic Web technologies in community, government and semantic smart city.
* Industrial trends related to the usage of Linked Data and Semantic Web technologies
* Description and analysis of concrete problems and user requirements for applying Semantic Web technologies in specific industry domains
* Analysis and evaluation of usability, assessment of pros and cons of using Semantic Web technologies in real-world scenarios including models of investment justifications (ROI)
