KESW is a top Russian venue for discussing research issues related to knowledge representation, Semantic Web, and Linked Data. Its aim is to bring together researchers, practitioners, and educators, in particular from ex-USSR, Eastern and Northern Europe, to present and share ideas regarding Semantic Web, and popularize the area in these regions.

The conference will consists of:

* Semantic Web School (Sep 30 - Oct 4 2014). We plan to invite the most experienced tutors from Russia and other countries.
* Hackathon (Oct 5-6 2014). 24 hours marathon to create public services using Open Data.
