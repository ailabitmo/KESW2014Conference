*What Can Ontology and Natural Language Do For Each Other?*

p<>. _A true ontology should provide a world model for the described domain, identifying its main concepts and tying them together with all relevant contentful properties. The question is how to get this model from text accurately? Assuming, as we do, that there is an accurate and unambiguous way of getting explicitly stated information from text, a lot of information is, in fact, implicit and yet crucial to the world model that we are creating. This implicit information has to be made explicit at the reasoning stage if we hope to come up with the results similar to human reasoning or understanding. And then again, some words in the text are unknown to a machine. Ontology should provide enough knowledge to guess the meaning of these words, as robustly as people do.  In this talk, we will look at various ways, requiring optimal human-computer hybrid collaboration, in which ontology helps text understanding and text helps with dynamic ontology development_.

p<>. Julia M. Taylor earned her Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering in 2008, M.S. in Computer Science in 2004, and B.S. in Computer Science and B. A. in Mathematics in 1999 at the University of Cincinnati.  After a short postdoc at the Cincinnati Children Hospital and Medical Center, she worked as Senior Research Engineer at RiverGlass, Inc. (2008-2011), improving and implementing the Ontological Semantic Technology for an analytics application. She was a Visiting Scholar at Purdue since 2008 and joined Center for Education and Research for Information Assurance and Security (CERIAS) as a Research Assistant Professor in June 2011. Since January 2012, she has been a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Computer and Information Technology as well as an elected Fellow of CERIAS. She has published a number of peer-reviewed papers in artificial intelligence, computational humor, computational semantics, fuzzy logic, information security, and robotic communication and intelligence. She has also served on the editorial boards of HUMOR: International Journal of Humor Research and European Journal of Humour Research.

p<>. Dr. Stefan Dietze is a Research Group Leader at the L3S Research Center (Germany) which he joined in 2011 following previous positions at the Knowledge Media Institute of The Open University (UK) and the Fraunhofer Institute for Software and Systems Engineering (Germany). His research interests are in Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies and their application to Web data integration problems in actual application domains. Stefan currently is leading the European R&D projects LinkedUp (http://linkedup-project.eu) and DURAARK (http://duraark.eu), both dealing with advancing Linked Data technologies and their take-up in real-world application settings. He also is involved in a number of other projects and initiatives in the Semantic Web area and is co-chair of the KEYSTONE (http://www.keystone-cost.eu/) working group on "Representation of Structured Data Sources". His work has been published in numerous conferences and journals, he is member of many organisation and programme committees and editorial boards and a frequent invited speaker.
