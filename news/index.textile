h3. April 16, 2014: Student Support

We encourage undergraduate and postgraduate students to apply for the conference registration fee waiver (aka "free registration"). The number of free registrations is limited (and yet unknown) and they will be distributed among the students with accepted papers on the first come first serve basis. To apply, send an email to the PC chair ("Pavel Klinov":mailto:pavel.klinov@uni-ulm.de). Please attach a letter from the supervisor to justify the need of funding to attend the conference.

Student support application deadline is end of August 2014.
